  "description": "1. Vision and Core Message - Goal: To empower Designers to bridge the gap between design and development by using AI to transform Figma designs into functional code. - Philosophy: Deep coding knowledge is not required; the focus is on directing AI to handle environment setup, writing code, and fixing bugs. - Value: It allows Designers to maintain 100% control over pixel-perfect output without being delayed by developer bottlenecks. ---------- 2. Competition Content - The Task: Each participant must convert a Whales Market Figma design into a fully functional React web app. - Mandatory Tech Stack: Participants must use React and Tailwind CSS. - Requirements: The app must feature multiple pages, navigation (routing), interactive logic (clicks, filters, modals), and display mock data. - Format: A 4-day, full-time individual assignment with no other company tasks. ---------- 3. The 4-Day Roadmap - Day 1 (Setup): Read the guidebook, familiarize yourself with the design, setup the environment using AI, and submit a public GitHub repository link. - Day 2 (Build): Convert main pages (Landing, Dashboard, etc.), set up routing, and implement JSON mock data. - Day 3 (Polish & Logic): Add interactive logic (search, tabs, filters), optimize for pixel accuracy, ensure mobile responsiveness, and prepare the AI Showcase. - Day 4 (Presentation): Perform a live demo of the app and answer questions from the Board of Judges. ---------- 4. Tools and Support - Recommended AI Tools: Antigravity (designer-friendly), Cursor (integrated with Figma MCP), and Claude Code (powerful CLI tool). - Credits: AI tool credits will be provided to participants as needed. - Advisory Team: Expert mentors are available via Telegram for technical setup (Lucas), AI prompting (Arthur), and product scope (Akemi). ---------- 5. Judging Criteria (Total 100 Points) - AI Utilization (30 pts): Evaluates how effectively you directed the AI and the quality of your AI Showcase (3–5 examples of smart prompts). - Pixel Accuracy & Logic (25 pts): How closely the layout matches Figma and whether the features work correctly. - Completion & Enthusiasm (20 pts): The percentage of the project scope completed. - Responsive & Interaction (15 pts): Quality of mobile responsiveness, animations, and hover states. - Presentation (10 pts): Clarity during the live demo and confidence in the Q&A. ---------- 6. Key Regulations - GitHub Updates: You must push code every day to show progress to the judges. - Deadlines: Deadlines are strict; late submissions will result in point deductions. - Persistence: Do not give up; if the task is too difficult, you may reduce the scope, but you must produce a working output. - Rewards: All participants receive a base reward, with the top 3 winning major prizes.",
